## ✨ What is GenerateMakefile?

**GenerateMakefile** is a lightweight, command-line Python utility that **automatically generates a simple, executable `Makefile`** for your C projects. Forget boilerplate\! Just tell it the desired executable name and the source files, and you're ready to compile. 🤯

If you're dealing with small to medium-sized projects and just need a quick, reliable `all` target, this script is your **best friend**. 🫂

## 🚀 Key Features — Why You Need This

  * **⚡️ Instant Makefile Generation:** Creates a valid `Makefile` with a single line command. No manual editing required.
  * **🎯 Smart Argument Filtering:** It intelligently separates your source files from flags (like `-make`), ensuring a clean build recipe every time.
  * **🔥 Automatic Compilation (Optional):** Use the magic flag to generate the file **AND** run `make` immediately\! **One command to rule them all.**
  * **✅ Cross-Platform:** It's Python\! It works wherever you code.

## 🛠️ How to Use It (It's ridiculously simple)

Generate the `Makefile` and stop.

```bash
$ python3 app.py <EXEC_NAME> <FILE1> <FILE2> ...
```

  * **Example:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
$ python3 app.py my_program main helper utils
```

This will create a `Makefile` containing:

```makefile
my_program: main.c helper.c utils.c
	cc main.c helper.c utils.c -o my_program
```

#### The Power-User Option: Generate and Make\!

Generate the `Makefile` **AND** immediately run the `make` command to compile your project. **Instant gratification\!** 🥳

```bash
$ python3 app.py <EXEC_NAME> <FILE1> <FILE2> ... -make
```

  * **Example:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
$ python3 app.py my_app server client -make
```

*(The `-make` flag is ignored when creating the file list but triggers the execution.)*

## 🧑‍💻 The Source Code (Under the Hood)

Here is the clean, efficient code that powers your automation:

```python
import sys
import subprocess as sp

def main():
    av = sys.argv
    ac = len(av)
    if ac < 3:
        print("Missing args: Usage: python3 app.py <EXEC_NAME> <FILE1> <FILE2> ... [-make]")
        return
    
    # Filter files from flags like -make
    file_names = [s for s in av[2:] if s[0] != '-']
    
    compiled_name = av[1]
    
    # Construct the required file list (target dependency line)
    req_files = ".c ".join(file_names) + ".c"
    
    # Construct the compilation command (recipe line)
    comp_line = "\tcc " + ".c ".join(file_names) + ".c -o " + compiled_name
    
    # Assemble the Makefile content
    line1 = compiled_name + ": " + req_files
    line2 = comp_line
    final = line1 + "\n" + line2

    # Write the file
    open("Makefile", "w").write(final)
    print("Makefile written successfully!")
    print("---")
    print(final)
    print("---")

    # The magic feature: Compile immediately!
    if "-make" in av:
        print("Running 'make' now...")
        sp.run("make", shell=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

⚙️ The Engine Under the Hood (C++ Power)

For maximum performance and system independence, this utility is compiled natively from C++! Unlike scripts that rely on external interpreters, GenerateMakefile executes external commands (make) using direct Unix system calls (fork(), execvp(), and wait()). This guarantees instantaneous, reliable execution and proper process synchronization. By using native code, you get a lightweight, blazing-fast utility that works straight out of the box on any Unix-like system, making your compilation process rock-solid and dependency-free.
